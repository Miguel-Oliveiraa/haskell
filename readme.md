I initially started learning Haskell for college, aiming to get good grades in functional programming. However, along the way, I ended up charmed with Elixir and the Erlang Virtual Machine (BEAM).

The BEAMâ€™s approach to parallelism at the network level and its natural fit for scaling distributed systems is fascinating, and it inspired me to explore functional programming more deeply.

This repository contains all the exercises I completed in Haskell. I see this as my first step in the journey of mastering functional programming, before diving into Elixir and the Phoenix framework.

I hope that by working through these exercises, I can build a strong foundation that will make learning Elixir and distributed systems easier and more intuitive.
